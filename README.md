# Getting Started

You can take a look my SPA on here : https://brkzmn.github.io/imdb-api-app/

## Development

<!-- To run this project locally you will need to open `index.html` in your browser using a local server. LiveServer, `http-server`, `study-lenses`, or any other local static server will work. -->


# Structure

<!--
Let's run through the folders:

```
public
src
└── pages
└── views
└── app.js
└── constants.js
└── data.js
└── router.js
index.html
```

- `public` this contains the static files that can be used by our `index.html` file
- `src` this contains all of our JavaScript code
 - `pages` this folder contains our functions that handle user interactions. You can also see it as the code that processes and updates the data or DOM
  it also contains our code that links up our handler code to the DOM.
 - `views` this contains code to define what the DOM will look like. They will create the DOM element and give it back. They should never read from/write to the dom, that is what the pages do.
- `app.js` this file our initialisation code. Generally this code should only run once and starts the application
- `data.js` this is our data model. Anything we need to store in the browser we place inside the data file
- `router.js` this file will transition the app from one page to the other and clear the HTML.
